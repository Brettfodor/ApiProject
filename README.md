# ApiProject

This is a WebAPI project containing frontend and backend folders. The back end can be opened and run in Visual Studio, and once running will interact with the front end which should be opened simultaneously in Visual Studio Code and "yarn start"-ed from the VS Code command line once the backend is running in Visual Studio. 

The project is a music collection/selector for an Italian scooter/coffeeshop co-op startup. The music is accessible to choose by artists, albums, or individual song. Also, you can choose artist and it will show all albums by that artist, or you can choose an album and see all songs displayed. 

User can also create, view all, edit and delete artists, songs and albums.
